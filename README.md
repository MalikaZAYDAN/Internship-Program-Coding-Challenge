# Internship-Program-Coding-Challenge

Idea of the app
The task is to implement a small Facebook-powered web app. The goal of the app is to let the user export photos from Facebook to Firebase.

Functional need that I developed
Via the app homepage, the user should be able to sign in using his Facebook account and grant access to his Facebook albums & photos.
After linking his/her Facebook account, the user should be able to see a grid of his/her albums from Facebook.
